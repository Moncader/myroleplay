Clicking the MyJob minimap Icon will open a window with a drop down list in the top corner of your current jobs while the rest will display the location, your schedule, and who your boss is.  Tabs will display your previous sales, your ranking at that job with others sellers, how much money you have earned in total and during each pay period while working there which is all grabbed from the owner, and the last tab is Shifts which will allow them to start and stop their shift, which starts and stops the money and item count.

--Uses Sky and the version information for each employees information is the server date and time, so it never messes up versions.
--All employees at one job will hold the information for all other employees, when another employee signs on, the versions are checked against each other and updated accordingly.  If the owner signs on, same thing happens.
